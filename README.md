# 30-Day Go Programming Challenge

Welcome to the **30-Day Go Programming Challenge**! This repository contains a series of projects and exercises, each completed over the span of 30 days, with the goal of enhancing Go programming skills and building a portfolio of projects. Each day focuses on a new project, increasing in complexity as the challenge progresses.

## Challenge Overview

This challenge is designed to provide practical, hands-on experience with Go, covering various programming concepts and real-world scenarios. Projects range from simple command-line tools to more advanced, real-time applications.

### Challenge Breakdown:

- **Week 1**: Foundational Projects (CLI tools, concurrency basics)
- **Week 2**: Intermediate Projects (Web APIs, WebSockets, encryption)
- **Week 3**: Advanced Projects (Game development, puzzle solvers, distributed systems)
- **Week 4**: Expert Projects (Multiplayer game backends, microservices, blockchain)

## Project List

Each folder in this repository represents one day of the challenge. The project for each day is stored in its respective folder:

1. [Day 1: Todo List Manager](./Day%201/)
2. Day 2: Prime Number Finder
3. Day 3: Simple Web Server with Routing
4. Day 4: Currency Converter with API
5. Day 5: File Downloader with Progress Bar
6. Day 6: Markdown to HTML Converter
7. Day 7: Web Scraper with Concurrency
8. ...
   
Check the specific `README.md` files in each day's folder for instructions on how to run and use that day's project.

## Goals

- Practice Go programming through real-world scenarios
- Learn new skills and concepts, including:
  - Concurrency with Goroutines and Channels
  - Web development with Go's `net/http` package
  - File I/O, JSON handling, and persistent data storage
  - Real-time multiplayer game backends
  - Distributed systems and microservices

## How to Use This Repository

Each folder contains:
- The Go code for that day's project.
- A `README.md` with instructions on how to run and use the project.

Feel free to clone or fork this repository, complete the challenge yourself, or use it as a learning resource for Go programming!
